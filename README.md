OBSERVATIONS

 

1. Student Performance by Grade:

Grade 2 has the highest student count, while grades 4 and 5 have significantly fewer students. Performance might decline in these grades.

 

2. Age Distribution:

The majority of students fall in the age group 22–25 (Type 2), as indicated by the dominant bar in the "Student ID by Student Age Type" chart.

 

3. Study Hours:

Most students study less than 5 hours weekly. This could explain lower performance in specific grade levels or GPA types.

 

4. High School Graduation Types:

The majority of students (71.03%) graduated from Type 3 high schools, potentially indicating a trend in the educational background of the cohort.

 

5. Scholarship Distribution:

Students receiving Scholarship Type 3 dominate, representing 50% of the cohort. Scholarship Types 4 and 5 have smaller representation.

 

6. Class Engagement (Listening):

Most students fall under Listening Type 2, showing moderate class engagement. Listening Types 3 and 4 have fewer students, which may correlate with lower grades or GPAs.

 

7. GPA Insights:

GPA Type 4 (3.00–3.49) is the most common among students, indicating good academic performance within the cohort.

 

8. Overall Student Count:

The dataset includes 145 students, a manageable sample for identifying patterns and trends.

1. Student Performance by Grade

- Conduct targeted interventions for students in grades 4 and 5, such as peer mentoring or personalized learning plans. 

- Identify challenges specific to these grades (e.g., curriculum difficulty, teaching methods) and address them through teacher training or resource adjustments.

 

2. Age Distribution

- Leverage this age group's maturity to introduce peer-led study groups or leadership roles to enhance engagement. 

- Provide career-focused workshops tailored to their stage in life (e.g., internships, resume building).

 

3. Study Hours

- Implement study accountability programs, like study logs or group study challenges, to increase hours spent studying. 

- Provide time management training and access to curated study resources. 

 

4. High School Graduation Types

- Analyze whether Type 3 high schools provide better preparatory skills and consider collaborations with these schools to replicate their best practices. 

- For students from less represented high school types, offer orientation programs to bridge any skill gaps.

 

5. Scholarship Distribution

- Review and adjust scholarship criteria to ensure broader access and equity among underrepresented scholarship groups. 

- Provide additional academic or financial support to students in Scholarship Types 4 and 5 to improve retention and outcomes.

 

6. Class Engagement (Listening)

- Introduce active learning techniques such as interactive discussions, quizzes, and problem-solving activities during class to improve listening engagement. 

- Use feedback surveys to identify why students in Types 3 and 4 are less engaged and address their concerns.

 

7. GPA Insights

- Introduce advanced academic opportunities, such as honors programs or research projects, for students in this GPA range to push them toward higher performance. 

- Offer targeted academic support, like tutoring, for students in lower GPA categories.

 

8. Overall Student Count

- Use the small cohort size to implement individualized academic counseling or performance reviews to address specific student needs. 

- Regularly track key metrics for this cohort and use findings to inform future strategies.
